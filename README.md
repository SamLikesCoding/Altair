# Altair : Archive Server
## Just a stupid project mimicking git

### Backstory
This was a random project which i made for fun and to store my projects in raspberry pi device connected to
an old hard drive. my goal here is to practice python and kill boredom. This project ain't complete, i'm still working on it

### Instructions
I've made three prototypes(TCP_Code, TCP_Code2 and UDP_Code), but directory structure are kinda same.

To run server
''''bash
cd Server
python3 server.py
''''

To create project
''''bash
python3 client.py plant 
''''

To pull project
''''bash
python3 client.py reap
''''

To test connection
''''bash
python3 client.py test
''''
